	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Iceout">Created especially for very cold monsters. Icechaser 2000 removes excess cold, so there is no more white frost in the house.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Bookshelf:1">History of the Veltiona. It is known that the original inhabitants of the Veltiona were humans. Then, from humankind, came elves, dwarfs and halflings. Some time after, monsters were thrown into this world. Due to significant bodily differences, both sides experienced a strong disgust to each other and then the war began. Despite having learned all those events nobody knows when exactly they have happened.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Bookshelf:2">Cult of the Sun. This faith began to spread 137 years ago, but it was created even earlier, approximately 834 years ago. It was founded by a man and a sphinx. Their people lived in deserts and, when the Big Drought came, they had to work together in order to survive. To create something common between the humans and monsters, they decided to bring a new faith. Only an unprecedented miracle could make that happen. The portals of the Sun altars and the marks of the Sun became this miracle. Nobody knows how these objects were created, but judging by the stories of the inhabitants of the desert, they were the gifts from the Sun. Faith, because of the convenience of portals and marks, was quickly adopted by the people of the desert, and they were the first ones to stop fighting each other, proving that peace between monsters and humans was possible.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Bookshelf:3">Monett. For a long time, monsters used the barter system, however, near the end of the war everyone was using monett for exchange. This money is made from mix of copper, mithril, silver and gold. To test them for authenticity, special magic devices are used.</Text> 
	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Bookshelf:4">Monsters. Monsters are not indigenous to this world. Despite the diversity of their size and forms, they still can be called one race. It is because all monsters initially had the ability to change their characteristics and appearance during their youth. To satisfy conditions of "class up" the monster had to gain experience of any kind. The easiest way is to win battles. The older the monster is, the more experience it needs to upgrade his class. Most monster clans refused the ability to raise their class, as this gives one advantage: children are not born as low ranked beings, but of the same species as one of the parents. However, the higher the parent's rank, the longer it will take for child to grow. </Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Bookshelf:5">Humans of the Veltiona Part I - Elves. Elves are known for their long lives, that’s why most of them are historians. Development of their muscles goes at much slower rate than any other human being, so they prefer to use magic. Most elves are well-known philosophers, magicians and archers, but there are those who have mastered the path of the blade. They use peculiar curved blades specifically designed for them.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Bookshelf:6">Humans of the Veltiona Part II - Dwarfs. Dwarfs life is usually two times than that of a normal human, they have a low amount of magic in them and also short builds. They have a very developed musculature, for this reason they are wider in the shoulders than humans. Dwarfs usually prefer to study technology and forging skills, because of their natural sturdiness they are able to survive mistakes that could kill any other member of the human race. However, there are cases when dwarfs have a high level of magic. Dwarven magicians have high affinity for magic of Electricity, Fire and Earth, most of them like to practice the necromancy. They clean revived corpses from flesh and paint the bones with radiant colors.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Bookshelf:7">Humans of the Vetliona Part III - Halflings. Halflings have a length similar to that of dwarfs, but their overall strength is same as humans of equally small size. The level of their magic is mostly medium. Their short stature is compensated by the high speed of thought, high endurance, and length of lives similar to the dwarfs. Halflings usually are great vendors and artists.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Library:Bookshelf:8">Humans of the Veltiona Part IV - Humans. Humans do not live as long as other members of their race, but they thrive as one of the oldest races of the Veltiona without any change in their physiology. That is because humans are very flexible, have a sufficiently high level of fertility, excellent learning ability and great persistence. Since humans have a relatively short duration of life, they are most prone to such things as greed, laziness, envy, and the like. But precisely because of their high emotionality, this race has reached the greatest heights in this world.</Text>

	<Text id="Dialog:Joshua:AboutYoungTime">Do you want me to tell you one moment from the time of my youth? I saw the war and remember the times when the peace was announced! In my younger years, I was like "WOOH!" or even "OOOMPH!", but even like that I was just a greenhorn who went to war for the sake of glory. And, believe me, I so much regretted it, don’t listen to those who say that the war time was a time of glory and triumph, it was just a meat grinder. The farther soldiers were from the capitals, the less was their desire to fight, and this applied to both sides. And here we are sitting in the stupendously uncomfortable swamps, tired and sad, when suddenly an orc, and a big one at that, approaches our squad. Of course, we were all shtumpidazed and prepared for the worst but then out of nowhere he tells us: "I  kinda uh ... I want to make a product trade". Everyone went dead silent after that, and then he says: "You give us salt and vegetables, and we’ll give you meat." Therefore, secret exchanges have begun: of course we didn’t trust him at first, but the days went by and such exchanges became more and more frequent, and this businessy relationship turned into a strong friendship. You know, the first exchange was due to the fact that they ran out of vegetables for their soup! H-Hah!</Text>

	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Simple:2">And I was invited to participate as the leader of this forest. Just imagine, all these legendary battles, historical moments! And I had a chance to get into history as one of the monster leaders who went against humans after all this time! Of course, cause you defeated me right now, I now have some doubts about my strength, and the strength of my army, but it's easy to fix by training and ...</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Simple:3">A-a-ah…yeah.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Simple:4">Eehrm ... he's here for ... I mean he is now undergoing an interview to enter my army!</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Simple:5">Do you understand what is going to happen now? I will try to make sure that the place you came from will not be noticed, but please don’t tell anyone that I lost to you in a fight.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Simple:6">And yeah, I won’t stop you any more, or it will affect the battle spirit.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Special:1">I just wanted to be worthy.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Special:2">I knew that the words coming from the seed actually belonged to my father, I just didn’t want to accept it. After your final strike I gave up on this fight and all the knowledge and feelings of my father could finally overcome my selfishness.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Special:3">Did you knew? One powerful monster is gathering an army in order to start a war with humans. I loved to hear the stories about the legendary moments at war ... and I suspected that war is also a very cruel time. But I really wanted to be famous for something that I did, and when the messenger from this monster came with a request to join – I accepted it. However, as you see, many inhabitants of this forest do not like this idea. And I almost sent them to a war they did not wanted to be part of, just because I felt offended. The messenger will come again today, in order to sell us the necessary equipment, I will tell her that I refuse to participate in this war... Maybe this will attract hatred from some, but now I'm protected by the honor and knowledge of my father. Hmm? It seems she is already close.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Special:4">I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Special:5">No, I just decided to refuse participation in this war.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Special:6">I will pay for the shipping cost, but I still won’t make a purchase.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Special:7">...</Text>

	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Defated_Special:9">And now I have to try to calm down the inhabitants of the forest, I don’t think that everything will go smoothly, but many will be able to sigh with relief.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Common_Simple">What? You want me to refuse participation in this war?</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Common_Simple:Yes">Hah! I won’t give up my chance to become famous! You know that humans are much weaker than us. The fact that I lost to you doesn’t mean that I will lose during the war.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:Leshii_Common_Simple:No">Then why are you eyeing me like that?</Text>

	<Text id="Dialog:AfterBattle1_Mob_3">The current Leshiy is not like his father, and perhaps he’ll never be like him. But what can do? According to the law of the forest, we have to obey him.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:AfterBattle2_Mob_1">MMmmmaaaaaannnn! I’m so tired, and you’ve beaten me pretty well. All we do is train and work, train and work. I want back those days when the father of the current Leshiy was the ruling one.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:AfterBattle2_Mob_2">You may not believe it but our boss is less than 50 years old, he’s very young for a leshiy!  The previous one was about 750 years before he became one with the Great Tree. The path to this mighty tree is much harder to find than it might seem, but it's worth it! </Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:AfterBattle2_Mob_3">Ya know? I knew our boss since he was very young. Many just like to compare him with his father, which made him very insecure. Imagine what will happen if a 7-year-old child is constantly told that he immediately has to achieve the same heights as the 100-year-old king.</Text>
	
	<Text id="Dialog:AfterBattle3_Mob_1">Sometimes a small glowing mosquito comes to our boss, after visits like this, leader forces us to train even harder. Before appearance of this mosquito, the boss was afraid to even show his face.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:AfterBattle3_Mob_2">Pst, I will tell you a secret, the way our boss looks now is not his real form, this form is very similar to his father’s, only smaller in size. His real form is much more fitting for his age.</Text>
	<Text id="Dialog:AfterBattle3_Mob_3">According to tradition, elder leshiy, in his last days, grants the younger one a seed of memory. This seed transfers all the knowledge of the previous leshiy to younger one to begin his growing phase, but the boss never got the seed. He quarreled with his father that day, and when he decided to make up with his father, it was too late. Similar situations happen very often, but this doesn’t make it any less sad.</Text>
